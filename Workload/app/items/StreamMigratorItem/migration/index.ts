/**
 * Stream Analytics to Eventstream migration engine.
 *
 * The mapping, assessment and emit modules are pure functions with no React or
 * Fabric client dependencies, so they can be exercised against captured ASA job
 * JSON without a tenant - see selftest.ts.
 *
 * The execute module is the exception: it talks to the Fabric item APIs, so it
 * is the one part that cannot be covered by the offline self-test.
